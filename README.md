Issues needs fixing: 
1. Dynamically generate video on teacher's screen when a students join the room (currently generate too many videos because a new <video> element is created each time a track event is fired)
2. Connection problems when there are more than 2 people in a room (students seems to lost connection with teacher)
3. Can't complete signaling when 2 peers are on different LANs (not sure whether it's because my network is slow). Runs smoothly when tested with 2 peers on the same LAN
