Issues needs fixing: 
1. Dynamically generate video on teacher's screen when a students join the room (currently generate too many videos because a new <video> element is created each time track event fired)
2. Connection problems when there are more than 2 people in a room (don't know if it's because running on localhost)
3. Get socket.io io undefined problem when deploying by using now.sh.
